INTV-01 Assignment
FDT-INTV-2 Final Take-home

Hope you got to learn a lot from the FDT sessions and had fun while building QTify!

Now is the time to apply the skills which you acquired through the workshop. In this assignment you have to build another web-app right from scratch.

Take your time, rewatch the session recordings if you want, review your notes, and refer to the materials provided to ensure that your assignment meets the objectives of the workshop. This is an opportunity to reflect on what you learned and apply your newfound skills in a practical way.

Note : If you haven’t yet, then please complete the QTify project (at least the 1st page) before starting out with this challenge.

In case you are feeling confused or have forgotten the process, feel free to refer to the prerequisite doc which we had shared with you at the beginning of QTify.


Things to take care of while building this take-home project:
1. Don’t jump in for coding right away. First plan, then execute. Make a copy of the solution approach sheet and fill in your approach for this take-home.
2. Break down the front-end into components and show-case your break-down using Excalidraw.
3. Feel free to use UI libraries such as Material UI, Swiper, or any other one with which you are familiar.
4. Ensure you use all the good coding practices covered in the sessions.
5. Make sure that the Carousel as well as the Accordion are functional.
6. Try to build your front-end as close to the given Figma design as possible.
